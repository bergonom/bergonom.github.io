<div>
<p>I figured out roughly how much fast food rewards points are worth in USD</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Chipotle</h2><h3>.61 - .77 cents per point</h3>
            <p>Methodology:<br />A burrito gives you the best value for your points. 1625 points can be redeemed for a burrito. At my local Chipotle, a steak burrito is $12.60. That averages out to about .77 cents per point. For comparison, 350 points can be redeemed for a bag of chips, which costs $2.15. That's only .61 cents per point.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Starbucks:</h2><h3>2.58 - 3.13 cents per point (star)</h3>
            <p>Methodology:<br />A breakfast sandwich gives you the best value for your points. 200 stars can be redeemed for an Impossible Breakfast sandwich. At my local Starbucks, this sandwich costs $6.25. That averages out to about 3.13 cents per star. For comparison, 300 points can be redeemed for a lunch sandwich, which costs $7.75. That's only 2.58 cents per star.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Chik-fil-a:</h2><h3>.47 - 1.15 cents per point (star)</h3>
            <p>Methodology:<br />"Icedream Cone" gives you the best value for your points. 200 stars can be redeemed for a cone. At my local Chik-fil-a, a cone costs $2.29. That averages out to about 1.15 cents per point. For comparison, 2500 points can be redeemed for a combo meal, the cheaest of which (a nuggets meal) costs $11.79. That's only .47 cents per point.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
