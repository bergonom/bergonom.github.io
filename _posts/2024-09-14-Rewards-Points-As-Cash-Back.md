<div>
<p>Fast food rewards points are essentially a "cash back" rewards system. For instance, if a restaurant offers one rewards point per dollar spent, and each rewards point is worth 1 cent, you're basically getting 1% cash back with each purchase. The points can't be redeemed for cash so technically it's not cash back, but you can redeem the points for something you would have otherwise paid for in cash, so it's close enough.</p>

        <li>
            <h2>Chipotle</h2><h3>6.1% - 7.7% cash back</h3>
            <p>Methodology:<br />Chipotle gives you 10 points for each dollar you spend. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-09-14-Rewards-Points-As-Cash-Back %}">Each point is worth roughly .61 - .77 cents</a>, so that means Chipotle is basically giving you back 6.1 - 7.7 cents per dollar spent.</p>
