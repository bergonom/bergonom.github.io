Keep in mind that you generally get a higher percentage return on less expensive items." />

<h1>How Much Are Restaurant Rewards Points Worth As Cash Back?</h1>



<div>
<p>Fast food rewards points are essentially a "cash back" rewards system. For instance, if a restaurant offers one rewards point per dollar spent, and each rewards point is worth 1 cent, you're basically getting 1% cash back with each purchase. The points can't be redeemed for cash so technically it's not cash back, but you can redeem the points for something you would have otherwise paid for in cash, so it's close enough.</p>
